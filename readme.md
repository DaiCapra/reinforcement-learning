# Reinforcement learning using Monte Carlo Tree Search
A collection of games were agents use the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to play against each other. The agents don't require any human supervision and will learn from self-play given the game rules.

## Playing a game of tic tac toe
Two agents play a game by simulating their next move with a UCT (Upper Confidence Bound 1 applied to trees) score. The agents are capable of solving the game and the only winning move is apparently not to play.
